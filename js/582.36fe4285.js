Originally, the clan was reformed out of the former and short lived Colonial Pathfinders [PF] clan which focused primarily on reconnaissance and partisan operations. After reforming, Echelon was formally founded as a logistics and support unit primarily tasked with providing logistical supply runs to allied fronts. Soon there after in November of 2020, ECH re-mustered as a combined arms clan encompassing a wide variety of roles within its ranks from logistics and engineering to infantry, artillery, armoured, and amphibious operations. This could be seen in the clan’s variety of operation types including the tragic defeat and slaughter of the clan and allies in a failed naval landing on the 21st of December, 2020. However, this is and was some speculation that this was at least in part due to failed allied-clan intelligence and information security. Shortly after this event, however, ECH successfully conducted naval landing operations as infantry and armoured elements in the Skull Beach landing of World Conquest 67, which would ultimately end the war with a Colonial victory. "),s,l,(0,i.Uk)("This period of time (December 2020) additionally saw ECH’s membership grow exponentially opening many doors for the future of the clan and its ambitions. Throughout this period ECH launched the ‘Moon Lake Project’ sometime during or before WC 66 in which the clan was preparing to construct and fire a ballistic missile (nuclear weapon). This would finally culminate in ECH firing its first nuke in World Conquest 68 (January 2021) at the end of the war effectively ending it. Albeit was a Warden victory, ECH saw fit to destroy the last Warden victory point in Hermit’s Rest’s town hall, rather than have Colonials sitting around waiting to lose. Throughout the spring and summer of 2021, ECH would continue to grow and begin solidifying various aspects of clan organization. This included a robust rank structure, the introduction of qualification tabs, medals and awards, and subdivisions of the clan i.e. corps and detachments. "),d,u,(0,i.Uk)("In October of 2021 Echelon celebrated its first year anniversary. For the remainder of the year ECH would embark on numerous base building projects, and ramp up its logistical efficiency. By the end of the year Echelon had established itself as a self sufficient and notable clan within the Colonial and broader Foxhole community. For much of the first half of 2022 ECH had run business as usual with regular ops, projects, etc. However, in the summer of 2022 ECH began a process of re-organizing its roster accounting for active and inactive personnel to paint a more realistic picture of its battlefield and support capabilities. Ultimately, by the end of summer 2022 ECH has set itself up for the highly anticipated 1.0 release in September 2022 ready and eager to adapt to the new dynamics of Foxhole for better or for worse.")])),_:1})])),_:1})])),_:1})])),_:1})])}const h=(0,i.aZ)({name:"aboutCard",setup(){return{lorem:"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
